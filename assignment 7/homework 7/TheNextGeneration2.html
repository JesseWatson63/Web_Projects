		<p> <center><h2>NCC-1701-D "The USS ENTERPRISE</h2></center> The ENTERPRISE is not just another ship.  It is the starship that aided CPT Jean-Luc Picard in his exploration of the unknown universe.  It housed on average 1000 men,women, and children.
		She was arguably the finest ship in star fleet. With the aid of CPT Picard and his crew, she managed to accomplish every mission that was put in front of her.
		The Enterprise 1701-D was the second of the Enterprises but in my opinion the best of all of them.  The Enterprise-D is first seen in the episode "Encounter at Farpoint" under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
		It was the third of its kind "Galaxy size star craft".  The saucer of the Galaxy-class Enterprise can separate and re-dock, a feature used sometimes to leave its civilian population behind when the stardrive section goes into combat.
		 The ship carries a variety of shuttlecraft and a captain's yacht (according to Patrick Stewart, the yacht is named Calypso, after Jacques Cousteau's research vessel; though visible on the underside of the Enterprise saucer, it did not make an appearance during the series).
		 She is a 24th century starship and the best there is.
